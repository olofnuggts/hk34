# Deep Learning

## Workflow

We will follow a standard 5-step deep learning workflow:

1. Data: Load and prepare the images.
2. Architecture: Design the Neural Network.
3. Loss & Optimizer: Choose how to measure error and how to improve.
4. Training Loop: The actual learning process.
5. Evaluation: Testing on new data.
